# Desktop Digital Website

## About

This project uses SVGs and iframes to present the experience of scrolling through a given website on a pre made desktop pc.

## Challenges

1. Creating an svg
2. Learning how to interact with an svg using javascript
3. Learning how to style an svg
4. Learning the restrictions of using iframes and finding a work around
5. Practising a sensible amount of responsive design.

## Things I learnt

- When building SVG's using inkscape, be careful to build from the ground up and give each layer a good name. it can be done although is a little fiddly. This helps styling and selecting in vanilla js.

- I got to practise some selective image rendering to using src set which was pretty nifty..

- Lastly I learnt that there are restrictions in terms of what can be displayed in an iframe.
